    title: 'NWSL looks to capitalize on Team USA\'s Olympic success',
    content:
        'The National Women\'s Soccer League has traditionally experienced increased interest following a successful U.S. run in a major international tournament.\n\nNWSL teams are poised to capitalize again as the regular season resumes this weekend in the wake of the reinvigorated U.S. team\'s gold medal run at the Paris Olympics.\n\n"These international tournaments give us an opportunity to measure our league on a world stage and see how our players are performing. And we couldn\'t have been prouder of the NWSL representation at the Olympics," commissioner Jessica Berman said. "Just being able to have representation across the world really affirms for us that our strategy about how we\'re going to attract more international talent is working."\n\nThe league hasn\'t had an opportunity for a post-championship bump in years as the United States hadn\'t claimed a title since the 2019 Women\'s World Cup. But the Americans went undefeated in France en route to a 1-0 victory over Brazil in the final for the team\'s first gold since 2012.\n\nThe match drew an average of 9 million viewers on NBC and Peacock, more than any women\'s final since the 2004 Athens Games. The slogan "Gold Plays Here" was splashed across a full-page ad in the New York Times with a celebratory photo of U.S. forwards Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Smith — all NWSL players.\n\nThis is the environment as the NWSL returns from a month-long break for the Olympics.\n\nOne of the biggest attendance bumps in the league\'s history came after the U.S. team\'s 2019 World Cup win. That year, attendance rose nearly 22% before dipping the next year due to COVID. Viewership for the NWSL championship game on ESPN jumped by 43% that year.\n\nFive years later, the league is in a better position to take advantage of the moment, Berman told The Associated Press.\n\n"For the first time, we have an infrastructure in the league that is prepared to launch a strategy that is coming out of the Olympics. So at the league level, we are coordinating across all of our clubs for back-to-market dates and making sure that the fans have an opportunity to celebrate the players who are returning back to the NWSL," she said.\n\nThe NWSL had 56 players — more than any other women\'s professional league globally — scattered among 11 of the 12 teams that played in France. Nineteen of the 22 U.S. Olympians play in the domestic league.',
